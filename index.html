            <p>
                Auragen Technologies is a smart energy startup bootstrapping operations out of Botswana,
                Sub Saharan Africa. We use dynamic & personalized advanced methods that translate into work-flow 
                engines that are relevant to the region's needs. 
                The described methods empower energy users by alloting them the requisite capital to achieve their 
                energy access goals.

                    Sub-Saharan Africa is home to <span>1.35 billion inhabitants</span>, with 6.9 ppl on average/household. 
                    This effectively means that the region is home to around <span>196 million homes</span> & over half 
                    of the region's inhabitants lack basic energy access. <span>Why you may ask? </span> Answer: 
                    <span>Processes</span> Everything is a process, even energy access falls under this <span>maxim</span>, 
                    i.e. to say better process management makes it conducive to access energy, without these processes
                    energy becomes inaccessible. 
                    Failure to develop better methods, processes etc. elicites the status quo the region is currently
                    experiencing.

                    <span>Auragen Innovations</span> as a startup looks to change this status quo through it's 
                    <span>Hermes Digital Experience Platform</span> that looks to correct the processes that have failed 
                    resolve the region's energy problems.

                            Everything & anything worth doing is a process, the questions surrounding the process
                            itself is control, ability & capabilities that ensure success. So failure is already
                            determined if the processes themselves are not right for a chosen task. That is why 
                            Auragen Innovations is dedicated to taking up the mantle of developing & managing task 
                            oriented methods that are optimized to bring about energy access, security & more.
                            
                            <span>Hermes,</span> a <span>digital experience platform</span> is an automated process demand response platform
                            for energy users seeking energy access. It is a resource database of sorts that empower
                            users to realize energy security comfortably at their own discretion.
                            This concierge like ability gives better response time & and all round availability. With

                <p>
                    Energy access is our customers endgame, it is our opinion that, one's own needs should be met by one's
                    own willingness to explore solutions to their own problem & that is now a possibility. With Auragen, 
                    customers can now explore autonomous standalone energy systems to resolve their energy needs, 
                    which they can lease without any upfront cost or budget.
